# Simon-Says
A memory challenge game created using HTML,CSS,JS and JQuery

In this game, a button with a colour lights up and upon choosing that colour, another button or the same button lights up and we have to choose the buttons in the order they appeared or the number of time those buttons lit up consecutively. If the wrong button is pressed or if the repetition of a specific button is missed, then the game ends and we have to reset the game.
